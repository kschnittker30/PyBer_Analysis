## Summary
Urban city types have higher volumes of rides and drivers as compared to suburban and rural. This goes in line with the denser population in urban areas with both residential and commericial riders. The averages for rural city types is much higher than urban and subsurban city types. Notably, the average fare per drivers in rurual city types are is almost 3.5 times higher than that of urban city types, while the average fare per ride was only 1.4 times higher from rural to urban city types.
