# Project Overview
PyBer is a ride-sharing app company valued a $2.3 billion. The rideshare data from January to early April 2019 will be analyzed to determine the weekly fare for each city type. The following metrics will be calculate: 
  1. Total rides by city type
  2. Total drivers by city type
  3. Total fares by city type
  4. Average fare per ride by city type
  5. Average fare per driver by city type

## Results

## Summary
Urban city types have higher volumes of rides and drivers as compared to suburban and rural. This goes in line with the denser population in urban areas with both residential and commericial riders. The averages for rural city types is much higher than urban and subsurban city types. Notably, the average fare per drivers in rural city types are is almost 3.5 times higher than that of urban city types, while the average fare per ride was only 1.4 times higher from rural to urban city types.

## Recommendations
Based on the the metrics, rural city types have very low drivers especially after comparing the average fares per drivers and average fare per ride with other city types. More analysis is needed to determine if there is a shortage of available drivers to meet rural rider needs. Rural areas are open and spread out with small population, which correlates to the lower riders and drivers compared to urban and suburban city types.  However, more information on the different reasons for ridesharing and distance per trip is needed to provide more insight into the disparities among the various city types. For instance, the higher volume in urban city types may be due to smaller, more frequent trips within a local area whereas rural areas may have longer, less frequent trips. The actual fare per mile of travel is not available, so determining if fares impact a consumers decision to use ridesharing cannot be made.  If we are to determine the miles of travel used and location of travel, we can make better decisions on ridesharing supply and demand. With more information we can determine if low driver availablity is causing a shortage of supply to meet rural area demand, or if an increase in easily available driver supply can lead to an increase in ridesharing demand.
